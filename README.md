## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned that it's not always best to follow the design pixel by pixel. Instead, I should treat it as a template and make adjustments to ensure it works well in practice.

I also learned that I need to structure my code better right from the start.

### Continued development

I will try to make my code more dynamic and easier to expand, especially in larger projects.
